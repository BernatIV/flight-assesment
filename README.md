# eWAS Node.js and Angular assesment

This is the eWAS Full Stack Developer Assesment that they give you to land its job. 
Their lack of respect showed me they didn't like my Angular code, which is vastly unfinished, but take a look at the backend here coded with Express JS. It can serve as an example to start a server that **handles requests**, connects to a **MySQL database** and **returns data with JSON format**. 


## INSTRUCTIONS TO START THE APP:

For node.js and Angular we have to run `npm install` to create the node_modules. 

The MySQL Database has been stored in AWS so the connection will happen automatically when running node.js, with `node app.js`.
A Postman Collection is provided to test out the backend section.
