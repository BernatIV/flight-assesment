# flights-assesment

So this is the eWAS Full Stack Developer Assesment.

I have completed the Backend successfully and I tested it with postman. The frontend, though, is unfinished due to lack of time. 


## INSTRUCTIONS TO START THE APP:

For node.js and Angular we have to run `npm install` to create the node_modules. 

The MySQL Database has been stored in AWS so the connection will happen automatically when running node.js, with `node app.js`.
A Postman Collection is provided to test out the backend section.

In the front we can only the side bar and a call to backend should work.
